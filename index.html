          Mathura, which lies at the centre of the cultural region of Braj[6]
          has an ancient history and is also believed to be the homeland and
          birthplace of Krishna, who belonged to the Yadu dynasty. According to
          the Archaeological Survey of India plaque at the Mathura Museum,[11]
          the city is mentioned in the oldest Indian epic, the Ramayana. In the
          epic, the Ikshwaku prince Shatrughna slays a demon called Lavanasura
          and claims the land. Afterwards, the place came to be known as
          Madhuvan as it was thickly wooded, then Madhupura and later
          Mathura.[12] The most important pilgrimage site in Mathura was Katra
          ('market place'), now referred to as Krishna Janmasthan ('the
          birthplace of Krishna'). Excavations at the site revealed pottery and
          terracotta dating to the sixth century BCE, the remains of a large
          Buddhist complex, including a monastery called Yasha Vihara of the
          Gupta period, as well as Jain sculptures of the same era.[
